<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<br>
The Hangman game is a word puzzle game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it one letter at a time. 
<br>
The game continues until the guesser either guesses the word correctly or makes too many incorrect guesses.

<h1>Game Rules:</h1>
<br>
You will implement a text-based version of the Hangman game with the following rules:
<br>
• You will choose the words’ length (typically 6 and above).
<br>
• Your goal is to guess the word letter by letter.
<br>
• You has a limited number of incorrect guesses.
<br>
• After each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn.
<br>
• You will win if they guess the word correctly before running out of guesses. Otherwise, the computer wins.
